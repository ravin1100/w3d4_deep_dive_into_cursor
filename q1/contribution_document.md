3. It's available in multiple languages, making it accessible to a global audience
4. It's actively maintained with regular merges of new contributions

**Repository URL:** https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions

## Issue Addressed
I fixed issue #99495: "Remove Slack link in the Tamil translation"

The issue involved the Tamil translation of the README that had an outdated Slack invitation link that no longer worked. The English version of the README had been updated to remove this link, but the Tamil translation still contained it, causing confusion for Tamil-speaking users.

My contribution:
1. Removed the outdated Slack link image at the top of the Tamil README
2. Replaced the text "Join our slack crew" with a link to the code contribution repository instead
3. Made the Tamil translation consistent with the English version of the README

This is an important fix because:
- It removes a non-functioning link that could confuse users
- It ensures consistency across different language versions of the documentation
- It improves the user experience for Tamil-speaking contributors

## Learning and Observations
Through this experience, I learned:

- How to create meaningful commit messages and pull requests

This was a small but meaningful contribution that helps improve the user experience for Tamil-speaking contributors who want to make their first open source contribution. I'm glad to have been able to help maintain this valuable resource.
